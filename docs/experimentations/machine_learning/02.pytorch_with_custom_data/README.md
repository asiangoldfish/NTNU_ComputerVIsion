# PyTorch with Custom Data
In this project, we will continue from [01.basic_pytorch](../01.basic_pytorch/README.md) and use a custom dataset, and create dataloaders and transforms. The code is taken from [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html) by [Sasank Chilamkurthy](https://chsasank.com/).

## Dependencies
For this project, you will need the following dependencies:

*Python Packages:*
- ipykernel
- numpy
- torch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-image

## Dataset
The project requires downloading dataset from [pytorch.org](https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/faces.zip). Download and extract it to `data/faces` directory.
