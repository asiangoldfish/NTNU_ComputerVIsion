# Experimentations

This folder contains experimental codes that may or may not be used in the project. It's a collection of smaller projects without relationship to one another, but to help us learn methodologies, techniques, technologies and best practises. Below, you will find a description about what each subfolder is about.

## Classical Computer Vision Methods
### [Computer Vision Methods](./computer_vision_methods/)
A collection of experimental scripts for performing image classifications using classical techniques like HOG, thresholding and edge detections.

# Deep Learning
### [Data Preparations](./data_preparations/)
Scripts that data augment training data to create variations. This leads to a larger dataset. 

### [Deep Learning](./deep_learning/)
Collection of deep learning experiments with descriptions of each step of the progression. It's designed for new to deep learning to roughly understand and to gain an overview in how DL is implemented in a Python application.
